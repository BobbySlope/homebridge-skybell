# homebridge-skybell

SkyBell HD Wi-Fi video doorbell plugin for [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).

SkyBell is a trademark owned by [SkyBell Technologies, Inc](http://www.skybell.com/).

## Installation

1. Install [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) using: `sudo apt-get install ffmpeg`
1. Install this plugin using: `npm install -g homebridge-skybell`
1. Edit `config.json` and add the SkyBell platform (see example below).
1. Run [Homebridge](https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge).
1. Add extra camera accessories using the Home app:
   1. Click on the **+** (in the top-right corner of the screen) and select *Add Accessory*.
   1. Select *Don't Have a Code or Can't Scan?*.
   1. Select the SkyBell HD camera accessory to be added.
   1. Ignore the warning about it being an *Uncertified Accessory* (which applies to all non-commercial accessories) and select *Add Anyway*.
   1. Enter the 8-digit setup code that Homebridge displayed when launched (possibly configured via a `pin` value in `config.json`).
   1. Select a room for the camera and motion sensor. They should be located in the same room, but not the *Default Room*.
 
### Config.json Example
```JSON
{
    "platforms":
    [{
        "platform":     "SkyBell",
        "username":     "skybell@gmail.com",
        "password":     "Passw0rd!"
    }]
}
```
The `username` (email address) and `password` are the ones used to log into the SkyBell HD app.

HomeKit accessories will be created automatically for all SkyBell HD (and SkyBell Trim Plus) doorbells associated with the account.

## Notes

### SkyBell API

SkyBell Technologies only share API details with selected third parties as part of their [SkyBell Connect API](http://www.skybell.com/skybell-connect/) program. This plugin instead uses the undocumented SkyBell cloud API used by their SkyBell HD app, as [reverse engineered](https://github.com/MisterWil/skybellpy) by Wil Schrader, but without the benefit of access to the Apple Push Notification service (APNs).

### Button and Motion Events

Button presses and motion events are detected by polling the SkyBell cloud for new video recordings being available. This typically results in a delay of several minutes between the event occurring and HomeKit being notified (and hence any automation being triggered). However, this is still typically quicker than the [SkyBell IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/skybell) channel.

The SkyBell cloud servers appear to be very heavily loaded. They typically take a few seconds to respond to each API request. This plugin leaves 5 seconds between successive polls of the activity log.

### Apple Home App

Apple's Home app (as of iOS 11) does not display *Doorbell* services; their characteristics cannot be viewed or controlled. For full functionality use one of:
* Matthias Hochgatterer's [Home](http://hochgatterer.me/home/) app *(recommended)*.
* Elgato's [Eve](https://www.elgato.com/en/eve/eve-app) app *(free)*.

However, Apple's Home app does generate rich notifications for both doorbell button presses and motion events. These appear with a small snapshot image from the camera. A larger image and live video stream can be viewed by sliding the notification left and selecting *View*.

### Video and Audio Streams
 
Viewing the live video stream from a SkyBell via HomeKit results in an *On demand* video being recorded, just as it does with the official SkyBell HD app.

For some reason the SkyBell cloud terminates the live video stream after approximately 45 seconds when viewed via HomeKit (instead of 5 minutes with the official SkyBell HD app). It is not obvious why this occurs.

This plugin currently only supports audio in a single direction: from the SkyBell's microphone to HomeKit. This is because the audio streams in each direction use the same ports, but unfortunately FFmpeg (which is used by this plugin to transcode the audio and video) does not support sharing a single port in this way for SRTP streams.
